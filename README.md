apkdiff
===

I am currently in the process of rewriting the tool in Rust. The Python tool still works fine.

---

Diff two version of an APK. Useful for seeing what changes have been made after an update.

The output is currently in a 'git diff'-style but there are plans for HTML reports.

Clone the repo and run `python apkdiff.py -h` to see all the options.
